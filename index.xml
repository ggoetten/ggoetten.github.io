      <description>Fenbendazole (FBZ) is a broad-spectrum anthelmintic administered orally to ruminants; nevertheless, its poor water solubility has been the main limitation to reaching satisfactory and sustained levels at the site of the target parasites. Hence, the exploitation of hot-melt extrusion (HME) and micro-injection moulding (µIM) for the manufacturing of extended-release tablets of plasticised solid dispersions of poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO)/polycaprolactone (PCL) and FBZ was investigated due to their unique suitability for semi-continuous manufacturing of pharmaceutical oral solid dosage forms.</description>

      <description>Abstract
Everolimus (EVR) has demonstrated efficacy in treating subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA) and other tuberous sclerosis (TSC) manifestations. Oral use of EVR is associated with low bioavailability and systemic toxicities culminating in treatment cessation in an appreciable patient population. To circumvent undesired effects, we developed a microsphere embedded formulation of EVR using polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) with an end-goal to achieve higher bioavailability and sustained delivery.
PVA-EVR microspheres were physically cross-linked using the freeze-thaw technique, and solvent-cast PVA-EVR films were developed as a control, without freezing and thawing cycles to ascertain the techniques significance.</description>

      <description>Abstract
Slow-release urea fertilisers have been shown to present acceptable values for plant yield and mitigate the harmful effect of soil emission gases. This study synthesises a slow-release fertiliser containing fumed-nanosilica, nanofibrillated cellulose as well as sodium alginate as a urea carrier to analyse the growth parameters of Eucalyptus urograndis seedlings and potential emission of soil gases, N2O, CH4, CO2 and ammonia volatilisation. The developed supraparticles, arranged layered nanoparticle structure, presented a decrease in the normal nitrogen content of urea of 19%, which is attributed to the binding of this element.</description>

      <description>Abstract
The photocatalytic behaviours of semiconductive ceramic nanoparticles such as TiO2, ZnO, Fe2O3, and Fe3O4, have been extensively studied in photocatalysis and photopolymerization, due to their ability to produce radical species under ultraviolet–visible light, and even in dark conditions. In addition, in the form of microparticles, TiO2 and its Magnéli phases are capable of neutralizing radical species, and a heterogeneous catalytic process has been suggested to explain this property, as it is well known as scavenging activity.</description>

      <description>Abstract
One possible way to reduce the environmental impacts of pesticides is by nanostructuring biocides in nanocarriers because this promotes high and localized biocidal activity and can avoid toxicity to non-target organisms. Neem oil (NO) is a natural pesticide with toxicity concerns to plants, fish, and other organisms. Thus, loading NO in a safe nanocarrier can contribute to minimizing its toxicity. For this study, we have characterized the integrity of a nanosilica-neem oil-based biocide delivery system (SiO2NP#NO BDS) and evaluated its effectiveness in reducing NO toxicity by the Allium cepa test.</description>

      <description>Polyvinyl alcohol/polyacrylic acid (PVA/PAA) bilayer hydrogel nanofibres were successfully fabricated by electrospinning and physically crosslinked via heat treatment. The effects of the thermal annealing process on the structure, morphology, swelling, thermal properties and hydrophilicity of electrospun nanofibres were investigated. In addition, these membranes were also used to incorporate doxorubicin and clarithromycin for osteosarcoma treatment, one in each layer. These drugs were used because it is hypothesized in this work that a synergism occurs between both drugs.</description>

      <description>Chalcones (1,3-diaryl-2-propen-1-ones) are naturally occurring polyphenols with known anticancer activity against a variety of tumor cell lines, including osteosarcoma (OS). In this paper, we present the preparation and characterization of spheres (~2 mm) from polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) containing a combination of 4′-Amino-1-Naphthyl-Chalcone (D14) and doxorubicin, to act as a new polymeric dual-drug anticancer delivery. D14 is a potent inhibitor of osteosarcoma progression and, when combined with doxorubicin, presents a synergetic effect; hence, physically crosslinked PVA spheres loaded with D14 and doxorubicin were prepared using liquid nitrogen and six freeze–thawing cycles.</description>

      <description>Cancer is one of the highest causes of deaths in the world; however, cancer treatment faces several difficulties, such as resistance to multiple medications, serious side effects and toxicities, and lack of targeted action. One potential effective approach is the application of the stimuli-responsive biopolymeric systems. Since the tumor environment has specific characteristics, these systems could be used in delivering anticancer drugs to the intracellular environment of the tumor cells, while minimizing localized damage to healthy cells.</description>

      <description>The effectiveness of tannic acid as antimicrobial and wound healing for burns have been shown for a century; however, uncontrolled target dosage may result in undesirable side-effects. Remarkably, tannic acid polyphenols compounds crosslinked with polymeric materials produce a strong composite containing the beneficial properties of this tannin. However, investigation of the crosslink structure and its antibacterial and regenerative properties are still unknown when using nanocellulose by mechanical defibrillation; additionally, due to the potential crosslink structure with chitosan, its structure can be complex.</description>

      <description>Kraft lignin, so far useful for energy generation, has been gathering considerable attention as an alternative material to replace fossil-based resources mainly due to its high phenolic content. However, the wide molecular weight distribution and chemical composition heterogeneity led to the development of fractionation methods. Herein, to narrow such characteristics we used eucalypt kraft lignin fractionated at pH&amp;rsquo;s 9, 7, 5 and 3 by sequential acid precipitation. These lignin fractions were first characterised by simultaneous pyrolysis and trimethylsilylation (SPyT) with N-Methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl) trifluoroacetamide with posterior tests of antioxidant, antibacterial, and antitumour activities.</description>

      <description>By seeding fungus on top of industry residues, a mycelium can grow and form a compact network structure; however, it may not develop due to lack of optimal nutrients from the substrate. Consequently, peach-palm residues can be a potential alternative; so, to test this hypothesis, this work evaluates the effect of peach-palm residues as substrate for the growth of mycelium based on Lentinula edodes. They were also supplemented with cassava bran and various sources of nitrogen-ammonium sulphate, potassium nitrate, and soy flour—to analyse its effects on its physico-chemical, enzymatic activities, and thermal and mechanical properties of the final composite at 12 and 20 days of cultivation.</description>

      <description>The seeds from Araucaria angustifolia —commonly named as pinhão—are important culturally, and viable regional food from Brazil. Although now considered an endangered species, methods to increase the awareness of this tree have been called upon attention. In light upon increasing such awareness, we utilized the seed coats of pinhão, which is considered a residue and discarded, in the development of cereal bars. Although the raw seed coats have a very high astringent flavor and impair the sensory taste; if considered as a nanoformulation, this strong astringent flavor is masked.</description>

      <description>Unidirectional freeze casting for polymers and ceramics has been performed extensively; however, the mechanisms involved in unidirectional freezing are not thoroughly understood and therefore, in this study, polyvinyl (alcohol) hydrogels were freeze-thawed by unidirectional freezing and the resultant freezing profile was investigated using thermal imagery to comprehend the physical mechanism involved in the production of these aligned cryogels. The approach used follows a slight variation from what is currently used in literature, by enclosing the mould with insulating materials and leaving one side with a metal encasing for a fast freezing flow from the direction of the desired aligned of the structure.</description>

      <description>In this work, a novel dual-response hydrogel for enhanced bone repair following multiple fractures was investigated. The conventional treatment of multiple bone fracture consists on removing smaller bone fragments from the body in a surgery, followed by the fixation of the bone using screws and plates. This work proposes an alternative for this treatment via in situ UV-initiated radical polymerization of a novel IPN hydrogel composed of PAA/P(NiPAAM-co-PEGDMA) incorporated with ceramic additives.</description>

      <description>Although freeze-thaw mechanism for producing crosslinked hydrogels is relatively easy and simple, it lacks sufficient integrity and support leading to modifications on its three-dimensional polymeric network arrangement during water removal—drying. Therefore, a strengthening method for obtaining cryogenic spheres of polyvinyl alcohol hydrogels is purposed by dispensing it as liquid droplets into a low temperature solution followed by a modification on its freeze-thaw cycles to confer a good geometry without aggregation. Various materials were incorporated into this hydrogel structure, including poly(acrylic acid) to impart pH sensitivity; hydroxyapatite to improve biocompatibility; and ciprofloxacin as an antimicrobial agent relevant for the treatment of osteomyelitis.</description>

      <description>A number of researches have been concerned about the development of β-type titanium alloys because they can present good biocompatibility, non-cytotoxicity, suitable mechanical and corrosion resistance behavior. However, due to their chemical inertness property, the surfaces of the novel Ti alloys must be modified by different methods to improve their bioactivity. This work is focused on the electrochemical surface modification of Ti-10Nb and Ti-20Nb alloys by Plasma Electrolytic Oxidation (PEO) method in 1.</description>

      <description>Although hydrogels produced via freeze-thawing (F/T) technique have been thoroughly studied in literature, stretching hydrogels in between freeze-thawing cycles could change its properties and might be modulated for drug delivery systems. The PVA hydrogels and Caffeine-contained PVA hydrogels were created by freezing for 20 minutes using liquid nitrogen and 4 hours thawing at 4 °C. The results revealed that the PVA/CAF hydrogel with two F/T cycles followed by two stretching (S) cycles delivered the best response.</description>

      <description>Porous TiO2 coatings were produced on commercially pure Ti substrates by micro-arc oxidation (MAO) in 1.0M H2SO4 electrolyte for different anodizing times. Their mechanical properties were assessed by means of instrumented indentation, XRD residual stress measurements and scratch resistance tests. The rutile/anatase ratio increased from ~0 up to 84% in the 10–360s anodizing time range, with further increase of coating thickness, porosity and roughness. Titania coatings produced for 180 and 360s had poor adhesion and uneven surfaces with spontaneous detachment from the substrate.</description>

      <description>Hydrogels are widely used for controlled delivery of therapeutic agents. However, hydrogels lack bioactivity to encourage bone formation and mechanical integrity. Moreover, chemically crosslinked hydrogels exhibit cytotoxic effect. To overcome these limitations poly-vinyl alcohol (PVA) and poly-acrylic acid (PAA) blends were combined with ceramic materials based on ? tricalcium phosphate, wollastonite, and magnesium silicate with different pore size distributions. The final 3D matrix was physically crosslinked using various freeze thawing (F/T) cycles.</description>

      <description>Extracted propolis has been used for a long time as a remedy. However, if the release rate of propolis is not controlled, the efficacy is reduced. To overcome this issue, extracted propolis was added to a cryogel system. Propolis collected from southern Brazil was extracted using different methods and loaded at different concentrations into polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and polyacrylic acid hydrogels as carrier systems. The material properties were investigated with a focus on the propolis release profiles and the cryogel antibacterial properties against 4 different bacteria, namely: Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, and Pseudomonas putida.</description>

      <description>Innovations on the field of smart hydrogels are now being held with loads of advantages. With recent progress, smart polymers can now be used on the market for specific target/objectives desired on medicine. However, the field of smart hydrogels has not been fully overviewed on the ground for drug delivery. In this study, a novel pH-sensitive smart hydrogel for drug delivery was investigated. Polyvinyl-alcohol (PVA) with polyacrylic acid (PAA) was blended adding synthetic hydroxyapatite (Hap) with freeze-thawed cycles and its effects were studied in terms of mechanical strength, bioactivity, and drug release profile.</description>

      <description>Hydrogels are three-dimensional cross-linked polymeric networks capable of imbibing substantial amounts of water or biological fluids and are widely used in biomedical applications, especially in pharmaceutical industry as drug delivery systems. Although their solvent content can be over 99%, hydrogels still retain the appearance and properties of solid materials, and the structural response can include a smart response to environmental stimuli (pH, temp, ionic strength, electric field, presence of enzyme, etc.</description>

      <description>Stimuli Sensitive hydrogels have enormous potential in various applications. Various environmental variables are found in the body, such as low pH and elevated temperatures. For this reason, either pH-sensitive and/or temperature-sensitive hydrogels can be used for site-specific controlled drug delivery. For many applications hydrogels require a very rapid time-response in terms of their sensitivity to either pH and/or temperature. Rapid time-responsive sensitivity is a research field which is still in development.</description>

      <description>The combination of shot blasting (SB) and micro-arc oxidation (or anodic oxidation&amp;mdash;AO) in titanium surfaces was shown to provide enhanced conditions for cell differentiation and osseointegration than those provided by SB or AO alone. This study associated both methods aiming to attain titania layers on Ti with adequate tribo-mechanical features for bone implants. SB was performed using alumina particles, and titania layers were grown by AO using a CaP-based electrolyte. Mechanical properties and scratch resistance were characterized at nanoscale by instrumented indentation and nanoscratch, and correlated with morphological and microstructural changes (XRD, SEM, EDS, AFM, and profilometry).</description>

      <description>Surface modification processes such as the alkali-heat treatment (AHT) can be employed in order to improve the titanium osseointegration with living tissues. Sodium titanate films produced by AHT presented high in vitro bioactivity when soaked in simulated body fluid. In order to produce bioactive surfaces and also improve the tribo-mechanical response of AHT films grown on Ti, samples were submitted to H, N and O low energy ion implantation (glow discharge—GD) at different working conditions.</description>

      <description>Rough and porous titanium oxide layers, which are important features for improving the osseointegration of Ti implants with bone tissues, are obtained through the technique of anodic oxidation. The thicknesses of such coatings are typically in the order of micrometers, and their mechanical characterization can be assessed by instrumented indentation, provided that the composite nature of the surface is considered. Titania anodic layers were produced on Ti under galvanostatic mode using Ca–P-based electrolytes (a mixture of (CH3COO)2Ca⋅H2O and NaH2PO4⋅2H2O), employing current densities (J) of 150 mA/cm2 and 300 mA/cm2.</description>

      <description>Anodic oxidation is a promising technique to become titanium surfaces bioactive, by simultaneously changing the surface morphology, structure and chemical properties. Calcium and phosphorus based electrolytes were used to produce anodic films on c.p. Ti with two different current densities, 150 mA/cm2 and 300 mA/cm2. Morphology and structure were examined by SEM, EDS and XRD, and elastic modulus and hardness of the surfaces by instrumented indentation. Besides rutile and anatase TiO2 phases, hydroxyapatite was also identified on the films, as well as the segregation of very soft Ca and P-rich zones.</description>
