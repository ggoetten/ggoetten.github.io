        "tag": "hydrogels",
        "abstract": "Freeze-thawing (F/T), a process widely reported in literature for crosslinking Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), is widely known in the science community to develop toxic-free hydrogels. Despite extensive characterization, optimizing both the viscous and elastic properties of hydrogels remains challenging. To address this issue, we studied the F/T mechanisms. The common understanding is due to the hydrogel transition that occurs within the solid-liquid interface upon freezing and subsequent thawing. However, in this study, we demonstrate that it is possible to crosslink PVA films prior F/T, i.e. after solvent-evaporation casting. This observation translates to crystallinity, swelling, and mechanical properties. When F/T was applied to cast films, the PVA exhibited an increase in melting enthalpy from 47.3 to 53.7 J/g and a rise in melting temperature from 207.5 to 223.0 °C. Moreover, post-casting F/T increased the storage modulus."

        "abstract": "Segmental bone defects represent a significant clinical challenge in orthopedic medicine, often resulting from trauma, infection, or tumor resection. Traditional treatments frequently fail to achieve adequate bone regeneration in large defects. This study evaluated the regenerative potential of a novel composite biomaterial combining Wollastonite, β-tricalcium phosphate (β-TCP), and polyethylene glycol dimethacrylate (PEGDMA) for treating segmental bone defects. The composite hydrogel was synthesized using 80% Wollastonite, 20% β-TCP, and PEGDMA polymeric matrix through foam replication and UV-curing techniques. Twelve New Zealand rabbits underwent surgical creation of 5 mm radius segmental defects. Animals were randomly assigned to implant group (GI, n= 6) receiving the composite biomaterial or control group (CG, n= 6) with standard plate fixation only."

This wastewater consists of the fractions of biocompounds soluble in hot water, extracted from leaves. Therefore, its exploration is part of the biorefinery strategies to minimize the use of fossil products towards sustainability using natural resources. Our research aims use the wastewater from C. citriodora leaves hydrodistillation industry recycling up to seven times to increase amount bioactive compounds and save water. The extracts with the highest concentration of biocompounds (7th extraction) were separated using functionalized silica and polymeric columns. The silica column was more efficient in recovering sugars (99 % total sugars, 72.5 % polyphenols), while the polymeric column was more efficient in recovering polyphenols (71 % total sugars, 82 % polyphenols)."

        "abstract": "This study presents a simple and cost-effective approach for synthesizing pyrolytic lignin-based carbon dots (CDPLs) via controlled thermal pyrolysis in water. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that pyrolytic lignin has been used as a precursor for carbon dots. The one-pot method produced blue/green fluorescent CDPLs with an average size of 34 nm and a negative surface charge of −10.4 mV. The characterization techniques revealed the optical properties and chemical composition of CDPLs, with a fluorescence quantum yield of 7.9%, which is comparable to those of lignin-derived carbon dots. The decay lifetime of CDPLs was in the nanosecond range, which is typical for carbon dots."

        "abstract": "This work utilizes the concept of curcumin amorphization to improve drawbacks currently found if it is used as a pharmaceutical ingredient, such as low solubility, limited bioavailability, and absorption, by anchoring it with silica nanoparticles (SiO2NP). Curcumin loading was determined following kinetic and adsorption parameters, resulting in more than 70% of the curcumin being loaded onto nanoparticles after 180 min. The adjusted data resulted in a Langmuir and BET best-fit with a coefficient relating to favorable adsorption and a multilayer mechanism. With a reduction of more than 70% of the particle area after curcumin loading, it increased the SiO2NP size. Due to curcumin, FTIR data presented a free unbounded vibration of SiO2NP, disappearing in favor of a chemical reaction."

However, its high hydrophilicity remains a key challenge for industrial applications. This review delves into both chemical and physical methods to enhance nanocellulose’s hydrophobicity while also exploring the incorporation of reinforcing fillers like antioxidants, antibacterial agents (e.g., tannins, lignin), and nanoclays to improve functionality in active packaging. Additionally, advanced surface modifications using compounds, such as stearic acid, silanes, and treatments, such as cold plasma, are discussed."

The textile industry continues to face challenges in developing coatings that combine performance, durability, and environmental responsibility. In this context, renewable nanostructures such as nanocellulose and nanolignin represent promisimg alternatives for integrating bio-based materials into textile coatings while reducing dependence on fully synthetic agents. As a functional finishing approach for textile applications, this study coated cotton fabrics with cellulose and lignin nanostructures."

Here, the focus was on the valorisation of Rhododendron ponticum, an invasive plant species in Ireland, into high-surface-area activated biochar through thermo-chemical treatments.

The activity of laccase and kinetic parameters was analysed by adjusting the buffer pH and ethanol:buffer ratio. The qualitative weighted average molecular weight (Mw) distribution showed significant variation when ethanol (40:60) solvent was used. GPC analysis confirmed the presence of fractions with higher molecular weight, where the Mw after 30 min was 7859, compared to 90 min in the buffer medium, where Mw was only 1779. These condensed units exhibited lower antioxidant values, characteristic of a polymerisation reaction."

This study explored the utilization of R. ponticum biomass as a source of microfibrillated cellulose (MFC) for fungal cultivation. The production of MFC was evaluated employing a novel cryocrushing treatment combined with a twin-screw extruder (TSE). The results demonstrated a significant increase in film strength, up to 332.3 MPa, with increasing TSE steps compared to 72.5 MPa in untreated samples. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis revealed a decrease in crystallinity from 68.93 % to 59.2 %, following cryocrushing and TSE treatment."

The samples processed through twin-screw extrusion exhibited the presence of NFC at five intervals, as confirmed by TEM analysis."

        "subjects": "Oral drug delivery, polyvinyl alcohol, pH-sensitivity, immediate release",
        "abstract": "Although freeze-thaw mechanism for producing crosslinked hydrogels is relatively easy and simple, it lacks sufficient integrity and support leading to modifications on its three-dimensional polymeric network arrangement during water removal—drying. Therefore, a strengthening method for obtaining cryogenic spheres of polyvinyl alcohol hydrogels is purposed by dispensing it as liquid droplets into a low temperature solution followed by a modification on its freeze-thaw cycles to confer a good geometry without aggregation. Various materials were incorporated into this hydrogel structure, including poly(acrylic acid) to impart pH sensitivity; hydroxyapatite to improve biocompatibility; and ciprofloxacin as an antimicrobial agent relevant for the treatment of osteomyelitis. The overall network presented a porous structure with a fibrous-like pattern which varied in size and volume, with presence of Ca and P when hydroxyapatite is incorporated. These materials varied the crystalline melting point of the poly(vinyl alcohol) and a linear pH sensitivity function was obtained by the addition of the materials. These hydrogels were found to release ciprofloxacin within 60 min and were able to dissolve at the same time intervals. Therefore, the hydrogel synthesised in this work can be used as an immediate release drug delivery mechanism for the in situ delivery of active pharmaceutical such as ciprofloxacin for a treatment of osteomyelitis."
